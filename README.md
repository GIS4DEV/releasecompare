# Analysis Plan
After accessing the data, I plan to:

- Ask the question: is Middlebury gaining or losing forest according to satellite imagery and local knowledge?
- Collect Landsat 5 and 8 data of Middlebury in the summer
- Talk to local resident who have lived in the area for at least 60 years
- Analyze the data
- Classify landsat data with supervised classification
- Visualize results over space and time
- Land cover maps for each decade
- Use correlation analysis to determine if local knowledge agrees with satellites about which decades in Middlebury's history contained the most forest cover.
- Write the report
