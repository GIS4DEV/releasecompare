# Analysis Plan
Before accessing the data, I plan to:

- Ask the question: is Middlebury gaining or losing forest according to satellite imagery and local knowledge?
- Collect some GIS data
- Talk to some people
- Analyze the data
- Visualize results over space and time
- Use correlation analysis to determine if local knowledge agrees with satellites about which decades in Middlebury's history contained the most forest cover.
- Write the report
